## Known bugs:

- Rotating pieces near the edge can cause them to partially appear on the row above.
- Right after a row is cleared, some divs on the top might receive the 'tetromino' class, causing a 'burn in' effect.

## Next steps:

- Technical:
    - Bug fixing
- Design:
    - Stylizing (choose a style, could be NES Tetris or other)
- Gameplay:
    - Implement Highscores
    - Levels (faster pieces, higher scores) based upon reaching certain scores
