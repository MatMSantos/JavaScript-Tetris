# JavaScript-Tetris
Little JavaScript project created by following this Youtube video:
[Code Tetris: JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw)

## Known bugs:

- Rotating pieces near the edge can cause them to partially appear on the row above.
- Right after a row is cleared, some divs on the top might receive the 'tetromino' class, causing a 'burn in' effect.
